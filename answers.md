Answer 3: GIT-ADD(1)                                  Git Manual                                  GIT-ADD(1)

NAME
       git-add - Add file contents to the index

SYNOPSIS
       git add [--verbose | -v] [--dry-run | -n] [--force | -f] [--interactive | -i] [--patch | -p]
                 [--edit | -e] [--[no-]all | --[no-]ignore-removal | [--update | -u]]
                 [--intent-to-add | -N] [--refresh] [--ignore-errors] [--ignore-missing] [--renormali
                 [--chmod=(+|-)x] [--] [<pathspec>...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to
       prepare the content staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of
       existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content with
       only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do
       not exist in the working tree anymore.

       The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot
       that is taken as the contents of the next commit. Thus after making any changes to the
       working tree, and before running the commit command, you must use the add command to add
       any new or modified files to the index.

       This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of
       the specified file(s) at the time the add command is run; if you want subsequent changes
       included in the next commit, then you must run git add again to add the new content to the
       index.

       The git status command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have changes that are
       staged for the next commit.

       The git add command will not add ignored files by default. If any ignored files were
       explicitly specified on the command line, git add will fail with a list of ignored files.
       Ignored files reached by directory recursion or filename globbing performed by Git (quote
       your globs before the shell) will be silently ignored. The git add command can be used to
       add ignored files with the -f (force) option.

       Please see git-commit(1) for alternative ways to add content to a commit.

OPTIONS
       <pathspec>...
           Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  *.c) can be given to add all matching
           files. Also a leading directory name (e.g.  dir to add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be
           given to update the index to match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g.
           specifying dir will record not just a file dir/file1 modified in the working tree, a
           file dir/file2 added to the working tree, but also a file dir/file3 removed from the
           working tree. Note that older versions of Git used to ignore removed files; use
           --no-all option if you want to add modified or new files but ignore removed ones.

           For more details about the <pathspec> syntax, see the pathspec entry in gitglossary(7).

       -n, --dry-run
           Donâ€™t actually add the file(s), just show if they exist and/or will be ignored.
